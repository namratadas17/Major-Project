# Major Project Proposal 

## Description 
I would like to present a viritual rendition of the well-known board game, Parcheesi, for my final project submission. Typically played with four people, the board contains a track along which each player must safely navigate four pieces to assigned "homes" from their respective starting positions. Though tasks such as board designing may be simple, the technicalities and rules of this games regarding the navigation of pieces along the circuit, obstruction of opponents, etc. to accurately replicate this game which will present challenges worthy of fulfilling the outcomes of this project. 

## Timeline


## Must Have List
- [ ] Start, end, and restart screens/states
- [ ] Instructions screen 
- [ ] Board for game
- [ ] Functioning dice (2) 
- [ ] Impliment rules (restrict movement of pieces eg. number of spaces, route, etc., rules for capturing opposing pieces, parameters for winning) 

## Nice To Have List
- [ ] Sound effects 
- [ ] AI for x (1 - 3) number of players against computer controlled players 
- [ ]
