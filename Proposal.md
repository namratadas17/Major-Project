# Major Project Proposal 

## Description 
I would like to present a viritual rendition of the well-known board game, Parcheesi, for my final project submission. Typically played with four people, the board contains a track along which each player must safely navigate four pieces to assigned "homes" from their respective starting positions. Though tasks such as board designing may be simple, accurately replicating the technicalities and rules of this games (concerning the navigation of pieces along the circuit, obstruction of opponents, etc.) will present challenges worthy of fulfilling the outcomes of this assignments. 

## Timeline
Given a timeframe of approximately two months, I plan to complete a rough board layout for this game by the beinnin May, focusing on completeing and submitting my overdue assignments during the remainder of April. Throughout the month of May, I want to have completed the 'Must Have List' for my game. If sufficient time remains, I hope I will be able to add some elements from my 'Nice To Have' List during June in order to elevate my project. 

## Must Have List
- [ ] Start, end, and restart screens/states
- [ ] Instructions screen 
- [ ] Board for game
- [ ] Functioning dice (2) 
- [ ] Impliment rules (restrict movement of pieces (eg. number of spaces, route, splitting dice rolls between pieces etc.), rules for capturing opposing pieces, parameters for winning) 

## Nice To Have List
- [ ] Sound effects 
- [ ] AI for x (1 - 3) number of players against computer controlled players 
- [ ] Improve aesthetics (ex/ 3-d rolling dice, colour, etc.) 
- [ ] Create and implement concept for the game
